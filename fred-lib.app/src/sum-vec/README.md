# FRED Client Application Example

This project contains an example of an application that leverages FRED to
accelerate some operations on the FPGA.

This application is part of the [FRED Framework Software Stack][fred]. To
build this application you must link it against the [FRED Client
Library][fred-cli-lib], to access the [FRED Server][fred-server].
