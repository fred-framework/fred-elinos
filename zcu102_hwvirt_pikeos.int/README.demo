# Project Name #
Hardware Virtualization with a Linux secure IO guest integration project

## Member Project(s) ##
ELinOS System Project using a PikeOS HWVIRT enabled secure I/O BSP

## Description ##
This integration project contains one HWVIRT partition, one HWVIRT
Linux guest process and two p4bus-Linux-devices. This project needs to
be used with a board supporting the Hardware Virtualization.

## Configuration of the Guest ##
_**Some configuration parameters of this demo depend on the used board therefore it**_
_**can not be completely automated and some manual steps are necessary.**_
_**Those are mandatory steps to build and run the demonstration.**_

* The integration project expects the output of a ELinOS System Project
    using a PikeOS secure I/O BSP for the used hardware and HWVIRT
    enabled.
    The location of the generated guest boot image has to be set in the
    HWVIRT host integration project. This has to be done by setting
    the 'Guest binary' option of the HWVIRT host. Additionally the
    pathes for the DTB and parameter file have to be adapted in the
    'Linux Boot' option.

* The ELinOS System Project should have enabled the TrustZone/HWVIRT
    P4Bus drivers for the console and network. This should be enabled by
    default.
    The network capabilties of the project may need to be set manually, if
    during creation of the sytsem project the 'Networking' option wasn't
    selected. Note that the usage of the networking feature is optional
    but recommended.

* The guest process component has a dependency to the used kernel
    component of the BSP. This dependency may have to be set manually.
    For this select the process component and in the dependency view
    look for the 'Depend: KERNEL' option and set it to the
    'hwvirt-kernel' dependency option.

* The HWVIRT guest has two P4Bus devices pre-configured. One will
    be used to provide a character device to the guest as a console. This
    is mapped to a MUXA channel. This is already done by default.
    The second device is pre-configured as a network device. This needs
    to be manually connected to one of the available network device files
    in the project. Please make sure to connect the P4Bus device to a
    network driver. The tools will allow to connect it to any file-provider.
    This may cause problems, if the wrong file is assigned.

##Â Configured devices ##
* guest1-dev1:
    - Host Type: vmfile (connected to muxa channel guest1)
    - Guest Type: vmtty
    - Guest Name: vmconsole

* guest1-dev2
    - Host Type: vmfile (must be connected to an Ethernet file-provider)
    - Guest Type: vmnet
    - Guest Name: eth0
