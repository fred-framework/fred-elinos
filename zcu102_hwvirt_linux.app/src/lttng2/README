This demo demonstrates the usage of the Userspace Tracer (UST).
It is a hello world application instrumented with LTTNG markers
used to test the LTTng userspace tracer.
Please start CODEO and connect to the trace server. You need to
start the application in order to see the user space traces in
the CODEO configuration dialog.
